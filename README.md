# CSS Device Mocks
http://cgons.github.io/css-device-mocks/

Mockups of popular devices using only CSS and HTML

A showcase of mocked devices can be found [here](http://cgons.github.io/css-device-mocks/).

#### Mocked Devices:
- Browser (roughly based on Chrome)
- iPhone 6

### Usage
Device mocks consist of two files:<br>
<sub>(all of which can be found inside the mocks directory)</sub>
  1. an HTML file<br>
  2. an SCSS file.<br>

<p>To use these mocks in your own project, simply include or copy/paste the mock HTML content and SCSS styles.</p>
